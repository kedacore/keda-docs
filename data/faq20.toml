- Use [Prometheus scaler](/docs/latest/scalers/prometheus/) to create scale rule based on metrics around HTTP events

KEDA allows you to use multiple triggers as part of the same `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob`.

- You will not have multiple `ScaledObject`'s or `ScaledJob`'s interfering with each other

We recommend not to combine using KEDA's `ScaledObject` with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload.

The target metric value is used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to make scaling decisions.

The current target value on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) often does not match with the metrics on the system you are scaling on. This is because of how the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler's (HPA) [scaling algorithm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details) works.

By default, KEDA scalers use average metrics (the `AverageValue` metric type). This means that the HPA will use the average value of the metric between the total amount of pods. As of KEDA v2.7, ScaledObjects also support the `Value` metric type. You can learn more about it [here](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/scaling-deployments/#triggers).

q = "Why does KEDA use external metrics and not custom metrics instead?"
a = """
Kubernetes allows you to autoscale based on custom & external metrics which are fundamentally different:
- **Custom metrics** are metrics that come from applications solely running on the Kubernetes cluster (Prometheus)
- **External metrics** are metrics that represent the state of an application/service that is running outside of the Kubernetes cluster (AWS, Azure, GCP, Datadog, etc.)

Because KEDA primarily serves metrics for metric sources outside of the Kubernetes cluster, it uses external metrics and not custom metrics.

This is why KEDA registers the `v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io` namespace in the API service. However, this is just an implementation detail as both offer the same functionality.

Read [about the different metric APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-apis) or [this article](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics) by Google Cloud to learn more.
"""

[[qna]]
q = "Can I run multiple metric servers serving external metrics in the same cluster?"
a = """
Unfortunately, you cannot do that.

Kubernetes currently only supports one metric server serving `external.metrics.k8s.io` metrics per cluster. This is because only one API Service can be registered to handle external metrics.

If you want to know what external metric server is currently registered, you can use the following command:

```shell
~  kubectl  get APIService/v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io
NAME                              SERVICE                                       AVAILABLE   AGE
v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io   keda-system/keda-operator-metrics-apiserver   True        457d
```

Once a new metric server is installed, it will overwrite the existing API Server registration and take over the `v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io` namespace. This will cause the previously installed metric server to be ignored.

There is an [open proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/custom-metrics-apiserver/issues/70) to allow multiple metric servers in the same cluster, but it's not implemented yet.

q = "How do I run KEDA with `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true`?"
a = """
As default, KEDA v2.10 or above sets `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true` as default without any other manual intervention.

If you are running KEDA v2.9 or below, you can't run KEDA with `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true` as default because Metrics adapter generates self-signed certificates during deployment and stores them on the root file system.
To overcome this, you can create a secret/configmap with a valid CA, cert and key and then mount it to the Metrics Deployment.
To use your certificate, you need to reference it in the container `args` section, e.g.:
```
args:
  - '--client-ca-file=/cabundle/service-ca.crt'
  - '--tls-cert-file=/certs/tls.crt'
  - '--tls-private-key-file=/certs/tls.key'
```
It is also possible to run KEDA with `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true` by creating an emptyDir volume and mounting it to the path where,
by default, metrics server writes its generated cert. The corresponding helm command is:
```
helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda \
  --set 'volumes.metricsApiServer.extraVolumes[0].name=keda-volume' \
  --set 'volumes.metricsApiServer.extraVolumeMounts[0].name=keda-volume' \

By default, Keda listens on TLS v1.1 and TLSv1.2, with the default Golang ciphersuites.
In some environments, these ciphers may be considered less secure, for example CBC ciphers.

As an alternative, you can configure the minimum TLS version to be v1.3 to increase security.
Since all modern clients support this version, there should be no impact in most scenarios.

You can set this with args - e.g.:
```
