KEDA is designed to be run on any Kubernetes cluster. It uses a CRD (custom resource definition) and the Kubernetes metric server so you will have to use a Kubernetes version which supports these. Any Kubernetes cluster >= 1.17.0 has been tested and is supported."

KEDA will scale a container using metrics from a scaler, but unfortunately there is no scaler today for HTTP workloads out-of-the-box.

We do, however, provide some alternative approaches:
- Use our HTTP add-on scaler which is currently in experimental stage ([GitHub](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on))
- Use [Prometheus scaler](/docs/latest/scalers/prometheus/) to create scale rule based on metrics around HTTP events
  - Read [Anirudh Garg's blog post](https://dev.to/anirudhgarg_99/scale-up-and-down-a-http-triggered-function-app-in-kubernetes-using-keda-4m42) to learn more.

KEDA allows you to use multiple triggers as part of the same `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob`.

By doing this, your autoscaling becomes better:
- All your autoscaling rules are in one place
- You will not have multiple `ScaledObject`'s or `ScaledJob`'s interfering with each other

KEDA will start scaling as soon as when one of the triggers meets the criteria. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) will calculate metrics for every scaler and use the highest desired replica count to scale the workload to.

We recommend not to combine using KEDA's `ScaledObject` with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload.

They will compete with each other resulting given KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) under the hood and will result in odd scaling behavior.

If you are using a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale on CPU and/or memory, we recommend using the [CPU scaler](/docs/latest/scalers/cpu/) & [Memory scaler](/docs/latest/scalers/memory/) scalers instead.

The target metric value is used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to make scaling decisions.

The current target value on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) often does not match with the metrics on the system you are scaling on. This is because of how the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler's (HPA) [scaling algorithm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details) works.

KEDA currently only supports average metrics. This means that the HPA will use the average value of the metric between the total amount of pods.

By default you can't run KEDA with `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true` because Metrics adapter generates self-signed certificates during deployment and stores them on the root file system.
To overcome this, you can create a secret/configmap with a valid CA, cert and key and then mount it to the Metrics Deployment.
To use your certificate, you need to reference it in the container `args` section, e.g.:
```
args:
  - '--client-ca-file=/cabundle/service-ca.crt'
  - '--tls-cert-file=/certs/tls.crt'
