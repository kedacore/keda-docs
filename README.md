We welcome issues and PRs! For details, see [Contributing to KEDA][].

If you submit a PR, Netlify will automatically create a [deploy preview][] so
that you can view your changes. Once merged, Netlify automatically deploys to
the production site [keda.sh][].

To see deploy logs and more, visit project's [dashboard][] -- Netlify login
required.
