# KEDA - Docs

Documentation and landing page for the KEDA project at https://keda.sh.

## Building docs locally

Install Hugo Extended:

### Windows

```sh
choco install hugo-extended
```

### Mac

```sh
brew install hugo
```

Run docs locally:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

## Adding blog posts

To add a new post to the [Keda blog](https://keda.sh/blog):

```sh
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```

This creates a boilerplate Markdown file in `content/blog/my-new-post.md` whose contents you can modify. The following fields are required:

* `title`
* `date` (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
* `author`

## Adding scaler documentation

To add documentation for a new KEDA [scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers):

```sh
hugo new --kind scaler docs/scalers/my-new-scaler.md
```

This creates a boilerplate Markdown file in `content/docs/scalers/my-new-scaler.md` whose contents you can modify. Make sure to update the following metadata fields:

* `title`
* `availability`
* `maintainer`
* `description`

## Updating the FAQ

To update the KEDA [FAQ page](https://keda.sh/docs/faq), update the TOML file at [`data/faq.toml`]. Here's an example question/answer pair:

```toml
[[qna]]
q = "How can I add a new question/answer pair?"
a = "You're looking at it! ðŸ˜€"
```

## Updating the troubleshooting page

To add a new section to the [troubleshooting page](https://keda.sh/docs/troubleshooting):

```sh
hugo new troubleshooting/my-new-issue.md
```

To adjust the order in which the troubleshooting tiles appear, use the `weight` parameter in each page's metadata.
