### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `gcp-pubsub` trigger for Google Cloud Platform‎ Pub/Sub.

```yaml
triggers:
- type: gcp-pubsub
  metadata:
    subscriptionSize: "5" # Deprecated, use mode and value fields instead
    mode: "SubscriptionSize" # Optional - Default is SubscriptionSize - SubscriptionSize or OldestUnackedMessageAge
    value: "5" # Optional - Default is 5 for SubscriptionSize | Default is 10 for OldestUnackedMessageAge
    activationValue: "10" # Optional - Default is 0
    subscriptionName: "mysubscription" # Required
    credentialsFromEnv: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON # Required
```

The Google Cloud Platform‎ (GCP) Pub/Sub trigger allows you to scale based on the number of messages or oldest unacked message age in your Pub/Sub subscription.

The `credentialsFromEnv` property maps to the name of an environment variable in the scale target (`scaleTargetRef`) that contains the service account credentials (JSON). KEDA will use those to connect to Google Cloud Platform and collect the required stack driver metrics in order to read the number of messages in the Pub/Sub subscription.

- `activationValue` - Target value for activating the scaler. Learn more about activation [here](./../concepts/scaling-deployments.md#activating-and-scaling-thresholds). (Default: `0`, Optional)

`subscriptionName` defines the subscription that should be monitored. You can use different formulas:

- Just the subscription name, in which case you will reference a subscription from the current project or the one specified in the credentials file used.
- Use the full link provided by Google, so that you can reference a subscription that is hosted in another project Eg: `projects/myproject/subscriptions/mysubscription`.

You can use either `subscriptionSize` to define the target average which the deployment will be scaled on or `mode` and `value` fields. `subscriptionSize` field is deprecated, it is recommended to use `mode` and `value` fields instead. Scaler will not work if you define both `subscriptionSize` and at least one of `mode` or `value`.
The mode chooses whether to scale using number of messages `SubscriptionSize` or using oldest unacked message age `OldestUnackedMessageAge`.
The `value` determines the target average which the deployment will be scaled on. The default value is 5 for `SubscriptionSize` and 10 for `OldestUnackedMessageAge`.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/kedacore/sample-go-gcppubsub).

### Authentication Parameters
You can use `TriggerAuthentication` CRD to configure the authenticate by providing the service account credentials in JSON.


**Credential based authentication:**

- `GoogleApplicationCredentials` - Service account credentials in JSON.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: pubsub-scaledobject
  namespace: keda-pubsub-test
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: keda-pubsub-go
  triggers:
  - type: gcp-pubsub
    metadata:
      mode: "SubscriptionSize"
      value: "5"
      subscriptionName: "mysubscription" # Required
      credentialsFromEnv: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON # Required
```

### Example using TriggerAuthentication

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: keda-trigger-auth-gcp-credentials
spec:
  secretTargetRef:
  - parameter: GoogleApplicationCredentials
    name: pubsub-secret        # Required. Refers to the name of the secret
    key: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON       # Required.
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: pubsub-scaledobject
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: keda-pubsub-go
  triggers:
  - type: gcp-pubsub
    authenticationRef:
      name: keda-trigger-auth-gcp-credentials
    metadata:
      subscriptionName: "input" # Required
```

**Identity based authentication:**

You can also use `TriggerAuthentication` CRD to configure the authentication using the associated service account of the running machine in Google Cloud. You only need to create a `TriggerAuthentication` as this example, and reference it in the `ScaledObject`. `ClusterTriggerAuthentication` can also be used if you intend to use it globally in your cluster.

### Example using TriggerAuthentication with GCP Identity

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: keda-trigger-auth-gcp-credentials
spec:
  podIdentity:
    provider: gcp
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: pubsub-scaledobject
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: keda-pubsub-go
  triggers:
  - type: gcp-pubsub
    authenticationRef:
      name: keda-trigger-auth-gcp-credentials
    metadata:
      subscriptionName: "input" # Required
```

## Example using ClusterTriggerAuthentication with GCP Identity

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterTriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: keda-clustertrigger-auth-gcp-credentials
spec:
  podIdentity:
    provider: gcp
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: pubsub-scaledobject
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: keda-pubsub-go
  triggers:
  - type: gcp-pubsub
    authenticationRef:
      name: keda-clustertrigger-auth-gcp-credentials
      kind: ClusterTriggerAuthentication
    metadata:
      subscriptionName: "input" # Required
```
