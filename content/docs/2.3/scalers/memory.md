> **Notice:**

> - This scaler only applies to ScaledObject, not to Scaling Jobs.

### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `memory` trigger that scales based on memory metrics.

```yaml
triggers:
- type: memory
  metadata:
    # Required
    type: Value/ Utilization/ AverageValue
    value: "60"
```

**Parameter list:**

- `type` - Type of metric to use. Options are `Utilization`, `Value`, or `AverageValue`
- `value` - Value to trigger scaling actions for
	- When using `Value`, the target value is the value of the metric itself (as a quantity)
	- When using `Utilization`, the target value is the average of the resource metric across all relevant pods, represented as a percentage of the requested value of the resource for the pods.
	- When using `AverageValue`, the target value is the target value of the average of the metric across all relevant pods (quantity).

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: memory-scaledobject
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: my-deployment
  triggers:
  - type: memory
    metadata:
      type: Utilization
      value: "50"
```
