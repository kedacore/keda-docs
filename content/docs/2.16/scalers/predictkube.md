PredictKube is an open-source project with the SAAS part consisting of an AI model that requires API to connect to the project for the main functions of predicting and scaling.

To make our AI model access your data and make a prediction based on it, please use the API key we'll send to your e-mail.

Review our [Privacy Policy](https://predictkube.com/privacy-policy) to see how your data circulates in and out PredictKube.

### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `predictkube` trigger that scales based on a predicting load based on `prometheus` metrics.

```yaml
triggers:
- type: predictkube
  metadata:
    # Required fields:
    predictHorizon: "2h"
    historyTimeWindow: "7d"
    prometheusAddress: http://<prometheus-host>:9090
    query: sum(rate(http_requests_total{deployment="my-deployment"}[2m]))
    queryStep: "2m"
    threshold: '100.50'
    activationThreshold: '50.1'
```

**Parameter list:**

- `predictHorizon` - Prediction time interval. It is usually equal to the cool-down period of your application.
- `historyTimeWindow` - Time range for which to request metrics from Prometheus. We recommend using minimum 7-14 days time window as historical data.
- `prometheusAddress` - Address of Prometheus server.
- `query` - Predict the query that will yield the value for the scaler to compare against the `threshold`. The query must return a vector/scalar single element response.
- `queryStep` - The maximum time between two slices within the boundaries for QML range query, used in the query.
- `threshold` - Value to start scaling for. (This value can be a float)
- `activationThreshold`- Target value for activating the scaler. Learn more about activation [here](./../concepts/scaling-deployments.md#activating-and-scaling-thresholds).(Default: `0`, Optional, This value can be a float)

### Authentication Parameters

Predictkube Scaler supports one type of authentication - authentication by API key.
Prometheus used in Predictkube Scaler supports all authentication methods that are available in Prometheus Scaler.

**Auth gateway based authentication:**

- `apiKey` - API key previously issued for this tenant. You can get your API key by clicking on any **GET API KEY** button on the [website of PredictKube](https://predictkube.com/)
