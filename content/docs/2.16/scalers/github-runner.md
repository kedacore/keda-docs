### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `github-runner-scaler` trigger that scales based on queued jobs in GitHub Actions.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: github-runner
    metadata:
      # Optional: The URL of the GitHub API, defaults to https://api.github.com
      githubApiURL: "https://api.github.com"
      # Required: The owner of the GitHub repository, or the organization that owns the repository
      owner: "{owner}"
      # Required: The scope of the runner, can be either "org" (organisation), "ent" (enterprise) or "repo" (repository)
      runnerScope: "{runnerScope}"
      # Optional: The list of repositories to scale, separated by comma
      repos: "{repos}"
      # Optional: The list of runner labels to scale on, separated by comma
      labels: "{labels}"
      # Optional: The target number of queued jobs to scale on
      targetWorkflowQueueLength: "1" # Default 1
      # Optional: The name of the application ID from the GitHub App
      applicationID: "{applicatonID}"
      # Optional: The name of the installation ID from the GitHub App once installed into Org or repo.
      installationID: "{installationID}"      
    authenticationRef:
      name: personalAccessToken or appKey triggerAuthentication Reference
```

**Parameter list:**

- `githubApiURL` - The URL of the GitHub API, defaults to https://api.github.com. You should only need to modify this if you have your own GitHub Appliance. (Optional)
- `owner` - The owner of the GitHub repository, or the organization that owns the repository. (Required)
- `runnerScope` - The scope of the runner, can be either "org", "ent" or "repo". (Required)
- `repos` - The list of repositories to scale, separated by comma. (Optional)
- `labels` - The list of runner labels to scale on, separated by comma. (Optional)
- `targetWorkflowQueueLength` - The target number of queued jobs to scale on. (Optional, Default: 1)
- `applicationID` - The name of the application ID from the GitHub App. (Optional, Required if installationID set)
- `installationID` - The name of the installation ID from the GitHub App once installed into Org or repo. (Optional, Required if applicationID set)

*Parameters from Environment Variables*

You can access each parameter from above using environment variables. When you specify the parameter in metadata with a suffix of `FromEnv`, 
the scaler will use the value from the environment variable. The environment variable must be available to the manifest. e.g. `labelsFromEnv: "RUNNER_LABELS"` will use the environment variable `RUNNER_LABELS` as the source fo the `labels` parameter.

- `githubApiURLFromEnv` - The URL of the GitHub API, defaults to https://api.github.com. You should only need to modify this if you have your own GitHub Appliance. (Optional)
- `ownerFromEnv` - The owner of the GitHub repository, or the organization that owns the repository. (Required)
- `runnerScopeFromEnv` - The scope of the runner, can be either "org", "ent" or "repo". (Required)
- `reposFromEnv` - The list of repositories to scale, separated by comma. (Optional)
- `labelsFromEnv` - The list of runner labels to scale on, separated by comma. (Optional)
- `targetWorkflowQueueLengthFromEnv` - The target number of queued jobs to scale on. (Optional, Default: 1)
- `applicationIDFromEnv` - The name of the application ID from the GitHub App. (Optional) (Required if installationID set)
- `installationIDFromEnv` - The name of the installation ID from the GitHub App once installed into Org or repo. (Optional) (Required if applicationID set)

### Authentication Parameters

You authenticate with GitHub using a Personal Access Token or a GitHub App private key via `TriggerAuthentication` configuration.

**Token or Key Authentication:**

- `personalAccessToken` - The Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub from your user. (Optional, Required if GitHub App not used)
- `appKey` - The private key for the GitHub App. This is the contents of the `.pem` file you downloaded when you created the GitHub App. (Optional, Required if applicationID set)

### Setting up the GitHub App

You can use the GitHub App to authenticate with GitHub. This is useful if you want a more secure method of authentication with higher rate limits.

1. Create a GitHub App in your organization or repository. ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app))
2. Make a note of the Application ID. You will need these to configure the scaler.
3. Disable Webhooks on your GitHub App.
4. Set the permissions for your GitHub App. The following permissions are required:
    - **Repository permissions**
        - Actions - Read-only
        - Administration - Read & Write
        - Metadata - Read-only
    - **Organization permissions**
        - Actions - Read-only
        - Metadata - Read-only
        - Self-hosted Runners - Read & write
5. Download the private key for the GitHub App. ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#generating-a-private-key))
6. Install the GitHub App on your organization or repository. ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/installing-github-apps))
7. Make a note of the Installation ID. You will need these to configure the scaler.

### How does it work?

The scaler will query the GitHub API to get the number of queued jobs in the specified repositories, subject to filters. If the number of queued jobs is equal to or greater than the `targetWorkflowQueueLength`,  the scaler will scale up.

We provide various options to have granular control over what runners to scale:
- **Repository Filtering** - If no `repos` are specified, the scaler will query all repositories in the specified `owner`. This is useful if you want to scale on all repositories in an organization, but will result in a lot of API calls and affect the Rate Limit.
- **Label-based Filtering** - The `labels` parameter is used to filter the runners that the scaler will scale. It uses the minimum applicable label for the runner. For example, if you have a runner with the labels `golang` and `helm`, and you specify `helm` in the `labels` field on the GitHub Action, the scaler will scale up that runner.

**API Query Chain**

The scaler will query the GitHub API in the following order:

- If no repos are specified: Get the list of repos for the specified owner.
- For each repo: Get the list of workflows runs in the repo.
- For each queued workflow run: Get the list of jobs in the queued workflow run.
- For each job: if the scaler matches, increment the queue length for that scaler.

**Notes on Rate Limits**

GitHub Documentation on Rate Limiting [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting)

Example: The GitHub API has a rate limit of standard 5000 requests per hour. The scaler will make 1 request per repository to get the list of workflows, 
and 1 request per queued workflow to get the list of jobs. If you have 100 repositories, and 10 queued workflows (across all those repos), the scaler will make 110 requests per scaler check (default: 30 secs). This is 3.6% of the hourly rate limit per 30 seconds.

Careful design of how you design your repository request layout can help reduce the number of API calls. Usage of the `repos` parameter is recommended to reduce the number of API calls to the GitHub API.

Note: This does not apply to a hosted appliance as there are no rate limits.

Additional Note: The GitHub App authentication method has a rate limit of 15000 rather than 5000 per hour.
