## Prometheus Exporter Metrics

### Operator

The KEDA Operator exposes Prometheus metrics which can be scraped on port `8080` at `/metrics`. The following metrics are being gathered:

- `keda_scaler_metrics_value`- The current value for each scaler's metric that would be used by the HPA in computing the target average.
- `keda_scaler_errors` - The number of errors that have occurred for each scaler.
- `keda_scaler_errors_total` - The total number of errors encountered for all scalers.
- `keda_scaled_object_errors`- The number of errors that have occurred for each ScaledObject.
- `keda_resource_totals` - Total number of KEDA custom resources per namespace for each custom resource type (CRD).
- `keda_trigger_totals` - Total number of triggers per trigger type.
- Metrics exposed by the `Operator SDK` framework as explained [here](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/advanced-topics/#metrics).

### Metrics Server

> ðŸ’¡ **DEPRECATED:** Prometheus Metrics exposed from Metrics Server are deprecated, please consume metrics from KEDA Operator.

The KEDA Metrics Adapter exposes Prometheus metrics which can be scraped on port `9022` (this can be changed by setting the `metrics-port` argument for the Metrics Adapter) at `/metrics`. The metrics collected in the Metrics Adapter are only active when the HPA is active (> 0 replicas).

The following metrics are being gathered:

- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_errors_total` - The total number of errors encountered for all scalers.
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaled_object_error_totals`- The number of errors that have occurred for each scaled object.
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_errors` - The number of errors that have occurred for each scaler.
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_metrics_value`- The current value for each scaler's metric that would be used by the HPA in computing the target average.

## Premade Grafana dashboard

A premade [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/tree/main/config/grafana/keda-dashboard.json) is available to visualize metrics exposed by the KEDA Metrics Adapter.

![KEDA Grafana dashboard](/img/grafana-dashboard.png)

The dashboard has two sections:

- Visualization of KEDA's metric server
- Visualization of the scale target and its changes in replicas scaled by KEDA

On top, the dashboard supports the following variables:

- datasource
- namespace
- scaledObject
- scaler
- metric
