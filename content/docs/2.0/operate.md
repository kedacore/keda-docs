## Cluster capacity requirements

The KEDA runtime require the following resources in a production-ready setup:

| Deployment     | CPU                     | Memory                        |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Operator       | Limit: 1, Request: 100m | Limit: 1000Mi, Request: 100Mi |
| Metrics Server | Limit: 1, Request: 100m | Limit: 1000Mi, Request: 100Mi |

These are used by default when deploying through YAML.

## Prometheus Exporter Metrics

The KEDA Metrics Adapter exposes Prometheus metrics which can be scraped on port `9022` (this can be changed by setting the `metrics-port` argument for the Metrics Adapter) at `/metrics`.  The metrics collected in the Metrics Adapter are only active when the HPA is active (> 0 replicas).

The following metrics are being gathered:

- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_error_totals` - The total number of errors encountered for all scalers
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaled_object_error_totals`- The number of errors that have occurred for each scaled object
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_errors` - The number of errors that have occurred for each scaler
- `keda_metrics_adapter_scaler_metrics_value`- The current value for each scaler's metric that would be used by the HPA in computing the target average.
