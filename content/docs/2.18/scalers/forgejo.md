### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `forgejo-runner` trigger for Forgejo Actions. It scales based on the amount of jobs pending in given runner labels.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: forgejo-runner
    metadata:
      # Required: the name of the registered runner 
      name: "forgejo-runner-ubuntu"
      # Required: the url of the forgejo instance 
      address: "http://localhost:3000"
      # Optional: Scope of the jobs to check, global is the default one and will get all the jobs in the instance with the defined labels
      global: "true" 
      # Optional: User to set as a scope, global should be false, if no repo is set will get all the pending jobs for the user
      owner: "cobak"
      # Optional: Repository level scope
      repo: "my-repo"
      # Required: Will get the jobs with match with this labels
      labels: "ubuntu-latest"
```

**Parameter list:**

- `name` - Name of the registered runner.
- `address` - Url of the forgejo instance.
- `global` - Scope of the jobs to check. (Values: `true`, `false`, Default: `true`, Optional, Mutually exclusice with `owner` and `repo`)
- `owner` - User to set as a scope. (Optional, Mutually exclusice with `global` and `repo`)
- `repo` - User to set as a scope. (Optional, Mutually exclusice with `global` and `owner`)
- `labels` - Labels to match the job with.


### Authentication Parameters

- `token` - Required token to connect to forgejo instance.

### Options on how to set the scope (global, user, repo)

1. If you set owner and repo KEDA forgejo scaler will retrieve jobs from that repository:
   ```
   owner: "username"
   repo: "my_repo"
   ```
2. If you set the organization will retrieve the organization jobs:
   ```
   org: "my_org"
   ```
3. If you set global: true will retrieve all the jobs from the instance
   ```
   global: "true"
   ```
4. And if you don't set any of this optional fields will retrieve the jobs from the user who creates the token 

## Configuration 

### Registering runners and binding config with autoscalers

To match job endpoints with job execution, we need to pre-register a runner, save the generated JSON file as a ConfigMap, and share it with the autoscaler. review the different ways to register a runner [here](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/runner-installation/#standard-registration), select the desired scope (user, repository or global) and create the corresponding JSON file. 

Autoscaler definition and runner registration should match to work as expected.

Create a .runner file and a registration file with this commands, and set the output in a configmap.

```shell
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  -v $PWD:/data --rm code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner:6.3.1 forgejo-runner register --no-interactive --token xxxx --name runner --instance http://localhost:3000/ --labels ubuntu-20:docker://node:20-bookworm,docker:docker://ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  -v $PWD:/data --rm code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner:6.3.1 forgejo-runner generate-config > registration.yaml 
```

```yaml

### Create a token on forgejo

The autoscaler will continuously fetch new waiting jobs from Forgejo, so it requires a properly configured token with the appropriate permissions. Navigate to **Forgejo > User settings > Applications > Access Tokens** and generate a new token. This token will be used by the autoscaler

### Configuring KEDA Autoscaler

Create a new custom resource with the required parameters and custom fields based on the scope chosen during runner registration. For example, set `global="true"` for global runners or specify `repo=xxx` and `owner=xxx` for repository level runners.

Choose the runner image you want to use (>6.1 of forgejo runner releases) or a custom one with `--one-job` command. 

Apply the new custom resource to your cluster.
