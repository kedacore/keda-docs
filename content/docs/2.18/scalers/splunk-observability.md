### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `splunk-observability` trigger that scales based on the result of a metric series queried from the Splunk Observability Cloud platform with a [SignalFlow query](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/signalflow/).


```yaml
triggers:
  - type: splunk-observability
    metadata:
      #Â Required: SignalFlow query to retrieve the desired metric time series
      query: "data('demo.trans.latency').max().publish()"
      # Required: Duration of the stream being created to query a Metric Time Series (MTS) from Splunk Observability Cloud. The specified duration is in seconds
      duration: "10"
      # Required: Threshold to reach to start scaling
      targetValue: "400.1"
      # Required: Target value for activating the scaler
      activationTargetValue: "1.1"
      # Required: Specifies how the Metrics Time Series should be processed, options are "min" (minimum value), "max" (maximum value), and "avg" (average value)
      queryAggregator: "avg"
```

**Parameter list:**

- `query` - SignalFlow query for querying the desired metrics.
- `duration` - Duration of the stream being created to query a Metric Time Series (MTS) from Splunk Observability Cloud. The specified duration is in seconds.
- `targetValue` - Threshold to reach to start scaling.
- `activationTargetValue` - Target value for activating the scaler. Learn more about activation [here](./../concepts/scaling-deployments.md#activating-and-scaling-thresholds).
- `queryAggregator` - When querying metrics from Splunk Observability Cloud, initially a Metric Time Series (MTS) is returned, a list consiting of several datapoints. The 'queryAggregator' speicifies how this series of metrics should be "rolled up". Valid values for this field are "avg", which returnes the average, "min", which returns the minimun of the metrics in the series, and "max", which returns the maximun value.

**Parameter list:**

- `accessToken` - Splunk Observability Cloud Access Token.
- `realm` - Splunk Observability Cloud Realm.

## Configuration Example

The following example shows how to scale a simple NGINX employment with the help of KEDA and the Splunk Observability Cloud scaler:

#### Simple NGINX employment

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

#### Authentication

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: splunk-secrets
data:
  accessToken: <base64-encoded Splunk Observability Cloud Access Token>
  realm: <base64-encoded Splunk Observability Cloud Realm>
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: keda-trigger-auth-splunk-secret
spec:
  secretTargetRef:
    - parameter: accessToken
      name: splunk-secrets
      key: accessToken
    - parameter: realm
      name: splunk-secrets
      key: realm
```

#### KEDA Scaler

```yaml
---
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: keda
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx
  pollingInterval: 30
  cooldownPeriod: 30
  minReplicaCount: 1
  maxReplicaCount: 10
  triggers:
    - type: splunk-observability
      metricType: Value
      metadata:
        query: "data('demo.trans.count', filter=filter('demo_host', 'server6'), rollup='rate').sum(by=['demo_host']).publish()"
        duration: "10"
        queryValue: "400.1"
        activationQueryValue: "1.1"
        queryAggregator: "max" # 'min', 'max', or 'avg'
      authenticationRef:
        name: keda-trigger-auth-splunk-secret
```
