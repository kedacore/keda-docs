> ðŸ’¡ The Admission Webhooks are an opt-in feature and will become an opt-out feature as of KEDA v2.12.

Admission webhooks require a valid certificate to expose the server for the api-server. To achieve this KEDA generates its own certificates and stores them in a secret.

While this is a good starting point, some end-users may want to use their own certificates which are generated from their own CA in order to improve security. This can be achieved by disabling the certificate rotation via setting the console argument `enable-cert-rotation=false` (or removing it) and mounting the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files to `/certs`. The path is also configurable using the console argument `webhooks-cert-dir=PATH-FOR-CERTS`.

By default, the admission webhooks are registered with `failurePolicy: Ignore`, this won't block the resources creation/update when the admission controller is not available. To ensure that the validation is always required and perform validation, setting `failurePolicy` to `Fail` is required.

### Prevention Rules

KEDA will block all incoming changes to `ScaledObject` that don't match these rules:

- The scaled workload (`scaledobject.spec.scaleTargetRef`) is already autoscaled by another other sources (other ScaledObject or HPA).
- CPU and/or Memory trigger are used and the scaled workload doesn't have the requests defined. **This rule doesn't apply to all the workload types, only to `Deployment` and `StatefulSet`.**
