## Kubernetes Events emitted by KEDA

KEDA emits the following [Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#event-v1-core):

| Event                                 | Type      | Description                                                                                                                 | CloudEvent Support |

## CloudEvent Support (Experimental)

### Subscribing to events with `CloudEventSource`
`CloudEventSource` resource can be used in KEDA for subscribing to events that are emitted to the user's defined CloudEvent sink.

> üìù Event will be emitted to both Kubernetes Events and CloudEvents Destination if CloudEventSource resource is created.

Here is a the schema of the `CloudEventSource` CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: CloudEventSource
metadata:
  name: {cloud-event-name}
spec:
  clusterName: {cluster-name} #Optional. Will be used in the source/subject to specify where the event comes from. The default value is 'kubernetes-default' and it can also be set during the installation of KEDA with --k8sClusterName. This one will overwrite others if set.
  destination:
    http:
      uri: http://foo.bar
```

In general, an event emitted by KEDA would fundamentally come down to the following structure:
```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.cloudeventsource.keda",
    "source" : "/{cluster-name}/{keda-namespace}/keda",
    "subject" : "/{cluster-name}/{namespace}/{object-type}/{object-name}",
    "id" : "<guid>",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
      "reason":"<event-reason>",
      "message":"<event-message>"
   }
}
```

### Event Sinks

There will be multiple types of destination to emit KEDA events to.

Here is an overview of the supported destinations:

- [HTTP endpoint](#http-endpoint).

#### HTTP endpoint
```yaml
  destination:
    http:
      uri: http://foo.bar  #An http endpoint that can receive cloudevent
```
