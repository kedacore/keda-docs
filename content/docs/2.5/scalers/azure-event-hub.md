### Trigger Specification

This specification describes the `azure-eventhub` trigger for Azure Event Hubs.

```yaml
triggers:
- type: azure-eventhub
  metadata:
    connectionFromEnv: EVENTHUB_CONNECTIONSTRING_ENV_NAME
    storageConnectionFromEnv: STORAGE_CONNECTIONSTRING_ENV_NAME
    consumerGroup: $Default
    unprocessedEventThreshold: '64'
    blobContainer: 'name_of_container'
```

**Parameter list:**

- `connectionFromEnv` - Name of the environment variable your deployment uses to get the connection string appended with `EntityPath=<event_hub_name>`.
- `storageConnectionFromEnv` - Name of the environment variable that provides connection string for Azure Storage Account to store checkpoint. As of now the Event Hub scaler only reads from Azure Blob Storage.
- `consumerGroup` - Consumer group of Azure Event Hub consumer. (default: `$default`)
- `unprocessedEventThreshold` - Average target value to trigger scaling actions. (Default: `64`, Optional)
- `blobContainer` - Container name to store checkpoint. This is needed for every `checkpointStrategy` except of `AzureFunction`. With Azure Functions the `blobContainer` is autogenerated and cannot be overridden.
- `checkpointStrategy` - configure the checkpoint behaviour of different Event Hub SDKs. (default: `""`)
    - `azureFunction` - Suitable for Azure Functions & Azure WebJobs SDK. This is the default setting, when `blobcontainer` is not specified.
    - `blobMetadata` - For all implementations that store checkpoint information on blob metadata such as current C#, Python, Java and JavaScript Event Hub SDKs.
    - `goSdk` - For all implementations using the [Golang SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-go)'s checkpointing, for example Dapr.
    - When no checkpoint strategy is specified, the Event Hub scaler will use backwards compatibility and able to scale older implementations of C#, Python or Java Event Hub SDKs. (see "Legacy checkpointing"). If this behaviour should be used, `blobContainer` is also required.

> ðŸ’¡ **Legacy Checkpointing:** C# applications, which use the `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs` package, Java applications which use the `azure-eventhubs-eph` package or Python applications which use the `azure-eventhub` below `v5` are supported if no `checkpointStrategy` is specified. These legacy implementations are based on the `EventProcessorHost` client, which stores checkpoint information as blob container content
> 
> C# Applications that use the current `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs` package, Java applications which use the current `azure-messaging-eventhubs` package or Python applications since `azure-eventhub v5`, have to set the `checkpointStrategy`to `blobMetadata`. All these implementations based on the `EventProcessorClient` which stores checkpoint information as blob metadata.

> ðŸ’¡ The Azure Storage connection string is not compatible with connection string created from a Shared Access Signature.
### Authentication Parameters

The common way of authenticating to Azure Event Hub is by using the connection string. However, you can use [Pod Identity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/demo/standard_walkthrough/) if you host your cluster in Azure AKS, and if have configured it to support Pod Identity.

To use Pod Identity, you have to add a [TriggerAuthentication](https://keda.sh/docs/2.0/concepts/authentication/#re-use-credentials-and-delegate-auth-with-triggerauthentication) and configure it to use Pod Identity like so:

```
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: nameOfTriggerAuth
  namespace: default
spec:
  podIdentity:
    provider: Azure
```

When you do so, the Event Hub scaler will depend on the existence of two configurations you have to provide: `eventHubNamespace` and `eventHubName`.


### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: azure-eventhub-scaledobject
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: azureeventhub-function
  triggers:
  - type: azure-eventhub
    metadata:
      # Required
      storageConnectionFromEnv: AzureWebJobsStorage
      # Required if not using Pod Identity
      connectionFromEnv: EventHub
      # Required if using Pod Identity
      eventHubNamespace: AzureEventHubNameSpace
      eventHubName: NameOfTheEventHub
# Optional
      consumerGroup: $Default # default: $Default
      unprocessedEventThreshold: '64' # default 64 events.
      blobContainer: ehcontainer
```
