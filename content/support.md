## OSS support
KEDA is an open-source project under CNCF Foundation and provides best-effort to support its community of users.

We have a nice community that is always happy to help each other. We support our users either via GitHub discussions or #Keda channel on the Kubernetes slack. We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests.

## Kubernetes support
The supported window of Kubernetes versions with KEDA is known as "N-2" which means that KEDA will provide support for running on N-2 at least.

However, maintainers can decide to extend this by supporting more minor versions based on the required CRDs being used; but there is no guarantee.

> Example - At time of writing, Kubernetes 1.19 is the latest minor version so KEDA can only use new features that were introduced in 1.17

You can learn more about the currently supported Kubernetes version in our FAQ.

## Commercial support
Here's an overview of all vendors that provide KEDA as part of their offering/product and provide support for it:
