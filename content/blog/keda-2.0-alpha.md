# Migrating to KEDA 2.0

We want it to be super simple to use 2.0 as an existing customer!

That's why we provide a [migration guide](https://keda.sh/docs/2.0/migration/) which walks you through the process of aligning with our new CRDs and are planning to provide [migration scripts](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/946) for our official release.

# Conclusion

We are looking forward to hearing your feedback:

- What do you like and/or what could be improved?
- What issues did you find?
- How can the migration be smoother?

While we are eagerly waiting for feedback, we plan to release KEDA 2.0 by the end of August, 2020.

Thanks for reading, and happy scaling!
