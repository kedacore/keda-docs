As maintainers, we are always eager to learn who is using KEDA ([become a listed end-user!](https://github.com/kedacore/keda#adopters---become-a-listed-keda-user)) and how they are using KEDA to scale their cloud-native workloads.

Our job is to make sure that your are able to scale the workloads that you run with as less friction as possible, production-grade security, insights on what is going on, etc.

In order to be successful, we need to learn how big of KEDA deployments end-users are running, what is causing frustration and what we can improve. This is why we have created a survey to gain more insights and make KEDA better.

**If you want to help shape KEDA's future, feel free to fill in [our 2-minute survey](https://forms.gle/Zv6yxzQvfgAB2pab8).**

Proud of your autoscaling infrastructure? You're more then welcome to show it in our [KEDA deployment show & tell discussion](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/discussions/4410) as well!

Thank you for helping make KEDA better!
