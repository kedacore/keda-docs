We recently completed our most recent release: 2.9.0 ðŸŽ‰!

Here are some highlights:

- Newly published Deprecations and Breaking Change policy ([docs](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md)) - this includes enforcing our Kubernetes compatability policy (meaning users will need to use Kubernetes >=1.23 with version 2.9.0)
- New Loki Scaler ([docs](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/loki/))
- All metrics exposed to prometheus are now consolidated in KEDA Operator, including some new metrics
- Azure Key Vault authentication provider now supports pod identities for authentication
- A ton of new features and fixes for some of our 50+ scalers

Potential breaking changes and deprecations include:
- As per our [support policy](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/SUPPORT.md), Kubernetes v1.23 or above is required and support for Kubernetes v1.22 or below was removed ([docs](https://keda.sh/docs/2.9/operate/cluster/#kubernetes-compatibility))
- Upgrading the API version of managed HPA objects from `autoscaling/v2beta2` to `autoscaling/v2`
- Prometheus metrics on KEDA Metric Server are deprecated in favor of Prometheus metrics on KEDA Operator ([#3972](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/3972) | [Discussion](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/discussions/3973))

You can keep an eye and join the discussion for future breaking changes and deprecations [in our GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Abreaking-change).

## Prometheus all the things

There are a number of improvements into the ways KEDA works with Prometheus. First, we've now consolidated all metrics to be retrieved from the KEDA operator. The operator exposes Prometheus metrics which can be scraped on port `8080` at `/metrics`. This does mean if you were using the KEDA Metrics Server previously you will want to move to this new and improved model. We also added a few new metrics including tracking the total number of `ScaledObjects`, `ScaledJobs`, and `TriggerAuthentication` objects.

## New & Improved Scalers

KEDA now has 50+ built-in scalers, giving you instant access to provide event driven scale across a variety of sources. New with this release are:
- Loki ([docs](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/loki/))

In addition to new scalers, various new features and improvements were added to Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Pipelines, GCP Storage, Metrics, NATS Jetstream, Prometheus, Pulsar, Azure Blob, GCP Stackdriver, and New Relic scalers. Details on the underlying fixes can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v290).

## And more...

This is just some of the highlights for the latest release. You can find the full release notes [here](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases/tag/v2.9.0).

The next KEDA release is [scheduled for March 2023](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

Thanks to everyone for helping make KEDA better!
