# Contributing to KEDA

Thanks for helping make KEDA better üòç.

There are many areas we can use contributions - documenting scalers, adding FAQ, troubleshooting, samples, and more.

Our documentation is versioned so it's important to make the changes for the correct KEDA version. If you need to introduce a new version, we recommend reading our documentation about it [here](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs#working-with-documentation-versions).

## Getting Help

If you have a question about KEDA or how best to contribute, the [#KEDA](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CKZJ36A5D) channel on the Kubernetes slack channel ([get an invite if you don't have one already](https://slack.k8s.io/)) is a good place to start. We also have regular [community stand-ups](https://github.com/kedacore/keda#community) to track ongoing work and discuss areas of contribution. For any issues with the product you can [create an issue](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/new) in this repo.

### Become a listed KEDA user!

Are you using KEDA in production? Do you want to become a [listed user](https://keda.sh/community/#users)? Say no more!

You can easily get listed by following these steps:

1. Upload your logo to `static/img/logos/` _(350x180)_
2. Configure your company as a new user in `config.toml` _(sorted alphabetically)_

```toml
[[params.users]]
url = "https://coralogix.com/"
logo = "coralogix.gif"
```

Here's a good example of [Coralogix becoming a listed user](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs/pull/182)!

### Become a listed KEDA commercial offering!

Do you offer commercial support for KEDA and want to become a [listed commercial offering](https://keda.sh/support/#commercial-support)? Say no more!

You can easily get listed by following these steps:

1. Upload your logo to `static/img/logos/` _(350x180)_
2. Configure your company as a new user in `config.toml` _(sorted alphabetically)_

```toml
[[params.vendors]]
url = "https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/custom-metrics-autoscaler-on-openshift"
logo = "red-hat.png"
```

### Adding blog post

To add a new post to the [KEDA blog](https://keda.sh/blog):

```console
$ hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```

This creates a boilerplate Markdown file in `content/blog/my-new-post.md` whose
contents you can modify. The following fields are required:

- `title`
- `date` (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
- `author`

### Adding scaler documentation

To add documentation for a new KEDA [scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers):

```console
$ hugo new --kind scaler docs/<VERSION>/scalers/my-new-scaler.md
```

This creates a boilerplate Markdown file in
`content/docs/<VERSION>/scalers/my-new-scaler.md` whose contents you can modify.
Make sure to update the following metadata fields:

- `title`
- `availability`
- `maintainer`
- `description`

### Writing documentation for a new authentication provider

To add documentation for a new [provider](https://keda.sh/docs/concepts/authentication):

```console
$ hugo new --kind provider docs/<VERSION>/providers/my-new-provider.md
```

This creates a boilerplate Markdown file in
`content/docs/<VERSION>/providers/my-new-provider.md` whose contents you can modify.
Make sure to update the following metadata fields:

- `title`

### Add new Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)

To update the KEDA [FAQ page](https://keda.sh/docs/faq), update the TOML file at
`data/faq20.toml`. Here's an example question/answer pair:

```toml
[[qna]]
q = "How can I add a new question/answer pair?"
a = "You're looking at it! üòÄ"
```

### Add new troubleshooting guidance

To add a new section to the [troubleshooting page](https://keda.sh/docs/troubleshooting):

```console
$ hugo new troubleshooting/<VERSION>/my-new-issue.md
```

To adjust the order in which the troubleshooting tiles appear, use the `weight`
parameter in each page's metadata.

### Writing documentation for a scaler

In order to maintain the style consistency across different scalers, all the
parameters which are listed have to be written using this convention:

- name - Description. (Values: x, y, z, Default: y, Optional, Extra Info)

If a parameter is required or doesn't have defined/default values, the missing
info should be removed from the pattern.

Here are a few examples:

> - `targetMetricValue` - Target value for your metric.
> - `metricFilter` - Aggregation method of the metric. (Values: `max`, `min`, `average`, `sum`, `variance`, Default: `average`, Optional)
> - `metricPeriod` - Granularity of the metric. (Default: `300`, Optional)
> - `subscriptionName` - Name of the Azure Service Bus queue to scale on. (Optional, Required when `topicName` is specified)

## Working with documentation versions

The KEDA documentation is versioned. Each version has its own subdirectory under
[content/docs](content/docs). To add a new version, follow these steps:

1. Copy the directory for the most recent version. Here's an example:

```console
$ cp -rf content/docs/<CurrentVersion> content/docs/<NewVersion>
```

2. Copy the file for the most recent faq data in the `data` directory. Here's an example:

```console
$ cp -rf data/faq<CurrentVersion> data/faq<NewVersion>
```

3. Navigate to the new faq file:

```console
$ cd content/docs/<NewVersion>/reference/faq.md
```

4. Update the versionData option

```
{{< faq20 versionData="NEW_FAQ_FILE_NAME" >}}
```

Replace `NEW_FAQ_FILE_NAME` with the file name of the faq data for the new version.

By default, new documentation versions are not listed as available version so
it's safe to make changes to them. After every release, the version will be
published as new version.

### Preparing a new version

Remember to create the folder for next version with already existing docs in
current version.

Make sure that the version on `content/docs/{next-version}/deploy.md` is updated
and uses the next version, instead of the current one. Ensure that Kubernetes cluster version is updated as well.

Ensure that compatibility matrix on `content/docs/{next-version}/operate/cluster.md` is updated with the compatibilities for the incoming version.

### Publishing a new version

Once a version is ready to be published, we must add the version to the
`params.versions.docs` list in [config.toml](config.toml).

More recent versions should be placed first in the list (ordering _does_ matter
because the first element in that list is considered the latest version).

> Note: Remember to [prepare the next version](#preparing-a-new-version).

## Developer Certificate of Origin: Signing your work

### Every commit needs to be signed

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the DCO, reformatted for readability:

```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Each Pull Request is checked whether or not commits in a Pull Request do contain a valid Signed-off-by line.

### I didn't sign my commit, now what?!

No worries - You can easily replay your changes, sign them and force push them!

```
git checkout <branch-name>
git reset $(git merge-base main <branch-name>)
git add -A
git commit -sm "one commit on <branch-name>"
git push --force
```

## Changing the website

### Creating and building a local environment

To build or serve the site locally, follow these steps:

- Fork and clone this repository (for local development only).
- Install the latest [LTS release][] of **Node**, using **[nvm][]** for example:
  ```console
  $ nvm install --lts
  ```
  **Note:** on Windows, the argument to install is `lts`.
- Get npm packages and other prerequisites:
  ```console
  $ npm install
  ```
- To build the site, run:
  ```console
  $ npm run build
  ```
  You'll find the generated site files under `public`.
- Serve the site locally at [localhost:8888][] using:
  ```console
  $ npm run serve
  ```

### Adding a new filter option

To add a new filter option, simply follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the doc file you want to annotate.
2. In the frontmatter, add your new filter option.

```
+++
FILTER_NAME = "filter_value"
+++
```

Replace FILTER_NAME with any desired name of your choice. Same applies to the value.

3. Navigate to the `list.lunr.json` file to edit: `cd layouts/_default/list.lunr.json`.
4. Open the file and go down to line 3. You will notice the format of the data represented in a key/value pair. Just before the closing parenthesis, append your new option like this: `"FILTER_NAME" $scalers.Params.FILTER_NAME`.

Replace FILTER_NAME with the same name represented in the frontmatter (see step 2 above for reference).

5. Head over to `config.toml` file. In the `params.lunr` section, you will see two arrays named `vars` and `params`. Add your new filter option's name to each of the arrays:

```toml
vars = ["title", "maintainer", "description", "availability", "category", "type", "FILTER_NAME"]
params = ["availability", "maintainer", "category", "type", "FILTER_NAME"]
```

6. Navigate to `javascript.html` and scroll down to where the `lunr()` function is being called. You will notice a callback function is being passed to the `lunr()` function. Within the callback function, you will also notice `this.field` being called with some values passed in. Append this block of code right after the last `this.field` function call:

```javascript
this.field("FILTER_NAME", {
  boost: 5,
});
```

Replace FILTER_NAME with the same name represented in the frontmatter (see step 2 above for reference).

Right after the `lunr()` function block, You will find where the `parse` object is being modified. Append your new filter option to the object:

```javascript
parse[doc.title] = {
  href: doc.href,
  title: doc.title,
  maintainer: doc.maintainer,
  description: doc.description,
  availability: doc.availability,
  category: doc.category,
  type: doc.type,
  FILTER_NAME: doc.FILTER_NAME,
};
```

7. Navigate to `layouts/partials/scaler-layout.html`. Locate the div with a class name of `filter-options`. Within the div, add this new block:

```html
<div class="has-extra-top-margin">
  <h6>FILTER_NAME</h6>
  {{ $FILTER_NAME := slice }} {{ range $scalers := where site.RegularPages
  ".CurrentSection.Title" "Scalers" }} {{ with $scalers.Params.FILTER_NAME }} {{
  $FILTER_NAME = $categories | append ($scalers.Params.FILTER_NAME) }} {{
  $FILTER_NAME = uniq $FILTER_NAME }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ range $FILTER_NAME
  }} {{ $item := . }}
  <div>
    <input
      id="{{ . }}"
      type="checkbox"
      name="resource_filter"
      value="FILTER_NAME:{{ . }}"
    />
    <label for="{{ . }}">{{ . }}</label>
  </div>
  {{ end }}
</div>
```

Replace FILTER_NAME with the same name represented in the frontmatter (see step 2 above for reference).

8. Save your changes and rebuild your frontend.
